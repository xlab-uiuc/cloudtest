Notes: The cost saving isnt huge in alpakka even
tho less number of tests run on the cloud. Surprisingly,
only one test has the biggest chunk of requests
and that is always run on the cloud. Test name:
(A_QueueSink_should_retry_failing_messages_if_supervision_strategy_is_resume)
Also the number of POST requests usually vary here causing
it to run on the cloud.
