**Main Idea**

The paper introduces a methodology for differential regression testing of REST APIs, aiming to identify breaking changes between API versions by comparing their behaviors against identical inputs.

**Challenges**

Key challenges include dealing with the variability and non-determinism in API responses, as well as abstracting away insignificant differences that do not impact the API's functionality.

**Solution**
To address these challenges, the paper proposes using RESTler, a stateful fuzzing tool, for generating and executing test cases on different API versions, and a novel approach for comparing responses to detect significant regressions.

**Limitations**
The limitations include the potential for false positives or negatives due to the complexity of accurately comparing API responses and the practical challenge of testing all possible combinations of client and service versions.
